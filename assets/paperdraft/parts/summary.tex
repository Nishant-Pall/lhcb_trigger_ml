A number of novel boosting algorithms have been presented that consider uniformity of selection efficiency in a multivariate space in addtion to misclassifcation errors.  Of these, the UGBFL algorithm has the best performance on the example analyses studied in this paper.
This algorithm is expected to be useful in a wide-variety of analyses performed in particle physics.
