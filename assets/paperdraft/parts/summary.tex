A number of novel boosting algorithms have been presented that consider uniformity of selection efficiency in a multivariate space in addition to mis-classifcation errors.  Of these, the uGBFL algorithm has the best performance on the example analyses studied in this paper.
This algorithm is expected to be useful in a wide-variety of analyses performed in particle physics.
